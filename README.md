# autometricsj

Autometrics is an observability micro-framework built for developers. It makes it easy to instrument any function with the most useful metrics: request rate, error rate, and latency. Autometrics uses instrumented function names to generate Prometheus queries so you donâ€™t need to hand-write complicated PromQL.

This is an implementation of Autometrics in Java. This implementation is built with AspectJ and is built to integrate with spring boot and micrometer.
